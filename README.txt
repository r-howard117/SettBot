# SettBot

SettBot is a Discord bot that retrieves and displays individual match statistics
from the game League of Legends, using Riot Games' public API. The goal of this
bot is to eliminate the need for users to screenshot their game client when they
want to share their games with friends. SettBot is loosely modeled after the 
in-game character Sett, and can send random quotes from the game in chat.

# Usage

SettBot is a personal project not specifically intended for any outside use.
It is open-source, however, and I encourage anyone to modify the bot to suit their needs.

# Contributors

While I did write all code myself, I followed UnderCtrl's extremely helpful 
YouTube tutorial for developing a Discord bot using Discord.js. I highly recommend
this guide to anyone looking to create their own Discord bot. https://www.youtube.com/@UnderCtrl/about


# Project status

At this time, SettBot is fairly bare-bones. I made sure to set up a robust
infrastructure in order to add more features down the line, however.

# Legal

SettBot was created under Riot Games' "Legal Jibber Jabber" policy using assets
owned by Riot Games.  Riot Games does not endorse or sponsor this project.
